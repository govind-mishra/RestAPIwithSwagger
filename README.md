When consuming a Web API, understanding its various methods can be challenging for a developer. Swagger, also known as OpenAPI, solves the problem of generating useful documentation and help pages for Web APIs. It provides benefits such as interactive documentation, client SDK generation, and API discoverability.

We are using <strong>Swashbuckle.AspNetCore</strong> package here to implement Swagger.
Swashbuckle.AspNetCore is an open source project for generating Swagger documents for ASP.NET Core Web APIs.
